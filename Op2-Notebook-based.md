----------

> [!NOTE]
> Ensure that you have a warehouse or lakehouse available to store the data. If you have the necessary permissions, you can create one. Below is an example of how to create a lakehouse.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Currently, you cannot attach a Lakehouse to a Fabric notebook via code, it must be done manually through the Fabric UI. Microsoft Fabric requires a Lakehouse
> to be explicitly attached to the notebook session so that Spark knows where to read/write tables. This attachment is handled through the notebook interface,
> not through PySpark code or a Spark config. <br/>
> - Open your notebook in Fabric. <br/>
> - In the left-panel, click `Add data item`, and choose from the dropdown. <br/>
> - Select the Lakehouse you want to use (e.g., the one with your workspace ID).

## PySpark approach 

1. Create a new notebook in your Fabric workspace (choose PySpark kernel).

2. Paste the content of the cells as shown in this notebook, or [upload the notebook](./src/notebook-date-hierarchy-pyspark.ipynb)

3. Run all cells to generate and save the date table.

4. Schedule the notebook in a Data Pipeline for automation.
5. Connect your Power BI dataset or other Fabric workloads to the Lakehouse table.

## T-SQL approach 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Use a Fabric Data Warehouse (not a Lakehouse SQL endpoint) if you want to run CREATE TABLE or CTAS statements.

1. Create a new notebook in Fabric (choose T-SQL kernel) or use a T-SQL script activity in a pipeline.
2. Paste, or [upload the notebook](./src/notebook-date-hierarchy-tsql.ipynb). 
3. Run all cells to generate and save the date table.

4. The table dbo.DateTable will be created in your Lakehouse or Warehouse.
5. Connect Power BI or other Fabric workloads to this table.

> [!TIP]
> **Best practices:**
> - All transformations and calculations are performed using **T-SQL** to ensure compatibility with Microsoft Fabric Data Warehouse and optimal performance.  
> - The solution is designed to be **parameter-driven** for easy reuse across different projects and environments.  
> - The output table (e.g., `DateTableFinal`) can be **shared across Power BI datasets** to maintain consistency in time intelligence across reports.  
> - For ongoing maintenance:  
>   - Update the **end date** in the source `DateRange` table as needed.  
>   - Refresh the **holiday list** to reflect current and upcoming public holidays.  
> - Avoid using temporary tables or table variables, as they are **currently not supported** in Fabric Data Warehouse. Use **permanent staging tables** or **CTEs** instead.  
> - Consider wrapping logic in **stored procedures** or **pipelines** for automation and scheduling.
